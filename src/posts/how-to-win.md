title: How To Win
---

Your score in each game contributes to your overall “Metascore,” and your metascore determines your rank on the overall leaderboard. So to win, you need to get the highest score you can in as many games as possible.

## Scoring Algorithm

*tl;dr: Each game rewards 1 trillion points per player: 500 billion based on performance, 500 billion based on podium positions.*

Here's how scoring works. Different games can give wildly different scores, so we first normalize scores from each game, so each game can give a maximum of 1,000,000,000,000 (1 Trillion) points. This is done by comparing your score to the top score in the game.

Holding a podium spot in any game is not going to be easy, and we want to reward the effort and skill that goes into it. For this reason, half of all the points available for each game are reserved for the podium.

With half of all points reserved for the podium, that means you can earn 500,000,000,000 (.5T) points based on your performance. Let's look at some examples:

- If your score is 10,000 and the high score is 25,000, you receive 200,000,000,000 (200B / .2T) points. (10,000 ÷ 25,000 * 500B)
- If your score is 5 and the high score is 1,200, you receive ~2B points. (5 ÷ 1200 * 500B)

Here's how many points you get for being on the podium:

- The highest score in the game receives 1,000,000,000,000 (1T) points.
- The second highest receives 50% of the podium bonus, for a total of 750,000,000,00 (.75T) points.
- Third highest receives 25% of the podmium bonus, for a total of .625T points.

Keep in mind that if the high score changes, your score will change, too. You'll need to keep a close eye on the leaderboard!
