Metascore is a companion app to the DSCVR Season 2 Hackathon. Game developers submitting games to the hackathon have the option to integrate their scoring system into Metascore. As a player, your “metascore” is the total of all your scores across all of the games in the hackathon.

**Who:** Anyone can participate as a player. Just show up and connect your your Stoic or Plug wallet (if you don't have one, it's easy!) and start playing games!    
    
**What:** Leaderboard hub and overall leaderboard for [DSCVR Season 2 Game Hackathon](https://h5aet-waaaa-aaaab-qaamq-cai.raw.ic0.app/post/139111/dscvr-hackathon-season-2-the-integrated-game), with NFT prizes for players.    
    
**When:** Hackathon submissions are open September 22-25. As soon as a game is released and added to Metascore, scores from that game will count toward your Metascore. We will announce a tournament closing date soon; expect a time shortly after submissions close.    
    
**Where:** [metascore.app](https://metascore.app).    
    
**Why:** Our prize pool is currently worth over 100 ICP ([check ICP price](https://ic.rocks/).) Metascore is a community driven project, and participants will have a voice on the direction of future tournaments.    
    
**How:** It's as simple as 1) connect your wallet, 2) play games, 3) win prizes.

This project has been built with contributions from many people in the Internet Computer community. It's also come together in a very short period of time. Please expect some bugs and work with us to overcome them.
